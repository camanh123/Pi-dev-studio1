"""
Edit History Ring Buffer

Global per-run tracking of the most recent file mutations so the ``file_undo``
tool can revert them. This is intentionally process-local and ephemeral:
it is cleared between runs (or when the buffer fills) and is not persisted.

Each entry captures:
    * ``path``          -- the file path that was (or will be) mutated
    * ``prev_content``  -- the content that was on disk BEFORE the mutation,
                          or ``None`` when the file did not previously exist
    * ``op``            -- one of ``"write"``, ``"edit"``, ``"patch"``,
                          ``"delete"``, ``"move_src"``, ``"move_dst"``
    * ``timestamp``     -- Unix epoch seconds captured at record time

The buffer is a fixed-size FIFO: once the capacity is reached, the oldest
entry is evicted on every new ``record`` call.

Thread/asyncio safety is provided by a single ``asyncio.Lock``. Callers
must be inside a running event loop to invoke the async API.
