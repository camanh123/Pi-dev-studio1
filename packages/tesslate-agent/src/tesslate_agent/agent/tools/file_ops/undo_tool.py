"""
File Undo Tool

Reverts the most recent mutation to a given file by popping the latest
matching entry off the shared :data:`EDIT_HISTORY` buffer and restoring
the recorded ``prev_content`` via the active orchestrator.

Semantics:
    * If the recorded ``prev_content`` is ``None``, the file did not exist
      before the recorded mutation. Undoing the mutation therefore deletes
      the file.
    * Otherwise, the recorded content is written back verbatim.
    * If nothing has been recorded for the path, the tool returns a
      structured error ("nothing to undo").

This tool does NOT cascade: calling it once restores the single most
recent mutation on that path, even if multiple mutations are queued up
in the buffer. Call it again to walk further back.
